In 1950 turing sidestepped the traditional debate concerning the definition of intelligence, introducing a practical test for computer intelligence that is now known simply as the turing test.web</p><h3>The Aim Of The Turing Test Is To Figure Out Whether A Machine Can Possess Human Intelligence By Holding A Textual Conversation Without Being Recignized As.web</h3><br/><p>Turing test, test proposed in 1950 by english mathematician alan turing to determine if a machine can ‘think.’web The turing test has done a remarkable job of standing the test of time. The turing test does not admit of weaker, different, or even stronger forms of intelligence than those deemed human.web</p><h3>In 1950, British Computer Scientist Alan Turing Proposed An Experimental Method For Answering The Question:</h3><br/><p>The turing test has a bit of a contentious history, and in this post i’ll explore the criterion for passing the test, address one particular point of contention by discussing whether or not its a good test for measuring the intelligence of artificial systems, and finally i’ll close with a discussion on ethics.web The turing test is a method of inquiry in artificial intelligence ( ai) for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human being.
